go doc prints the documentation for a package, const, func, type, var or method
    - go doc accepts zero, one or two arguments

    - zero
        * prints package documentation for the package in the current directory
            - go doc
    
    - one
        * arguments Go-syntax-like representation of item to be documented
            ~ fyi: <sym> also known as "identifier"
            - go doc <pkg>
            - go doc <sym>[.<method>]
            - go doc [<pkg>.]<sym>[.<method>]
            - go doc [<pkg>.][<sym>.]<method>
        * The first item in this list that succeeds is the one whose
          documentation is printed. If there is a symbol but no package, the
          package in the current directory is chosen. However, if the
          argument begins with a capital letter it always assumed to be a
          symbol in the current directory.
    
    - two
        * first argument must be a full package path
            - go doc <pkg> <sym>[.<method>]
